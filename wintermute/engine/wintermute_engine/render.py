"""Text rendering of the internal state, as Wintermute receives it.

He is never shown his own numbers: a body is felt, not read. Three registers:
  * drives:   what pulls, named, in sensations (strongest first);
  * body:     what the hormones feel like, plus the one thing that is truly a number to him,
              what he has left to spend;
  * texture:  the unconscious, in prose, never named.
The numbers stay for the operator (``wm``).
